                    <p>
                        This is a timeline of all my major progressions in Bee Swarm Simulator. 
                        Just know that it takes several months and years to reach the end game.
                        Bee Swarm Simulator isn't pay to win (meaning you can't pay in order to beat or progress faster).
                        You must grind the game manually.
                        However, as you reach a certain level in the game, you can macro (automatically play with a bot) to grind for materials to beat the game.

                        2022 marks the first time I ever entered the game. I saw it on my Roblox discovery page
                        and wanted to try it out. Upon enetering it was pretty boring as it was different from other games. 
                        The game took me 1 hour to get 100 honey to get my first in game tool. Since there were still many other stages,
                        I took a break from Bee Swarm Simulator.

                        I have returned to the game after 1 year. I found my cousin playing and decided to join him. 
                        From there, I saw the youtubers who have already reached the end game and was inspired to join them. 
                        So I decided to grind the game and got all the mountain top gear

                        After a while of grinding, I was at a stage where I could begin building the hive color I wanted. After a while of decision making, I decided to be a red hive and grind for the demon mask. 
                        This took me so long considering I had to do it manually and all the macros (bots for playing the game 24/7) at the time were only available on windows computers which I didnt have. 
                        So I had to do everything manually. After a while I got the demon mask.

                        When the first macos macro came out, it was called existance macro. It was extremely bad, however, it was better than nothing. 
                        After using it for a couple of days I realised that macroing as a red hive (demon mask) is not efficient.
                        So I decided again to switch hive colors from red to blue, thus beginning my grind for the diamond mask (blue hive mask).

                        They say new year new me. I got a new bee! I got the tadpole bee as my first mythic. To put things into perspective, there is only a 0.0001 chance of getting a mythic bee from royal jellies (the thing that you use to roll bees). 
                        It took me a long time to get my first mythic and cost me around 20 million royal jellies. This was very memorable as I remember I was playing on my phone in class when I got it. 
                        I'm only still mid-game after taking 2 slow years of grinding. This just shows how hard and time consuming Bee swarm simulator is.

                        After months of grinding, I finally was able to craft the coconut canister. This marks a significant moment in my progression as this is the first step into the end game. I have worked tirelessly day and night without the help of a macro because 
                        macOS doesn't support autohotkey (a bot input setting). After all the months of grinding, the bug killing for materials, the coconut crab farming. This has all lead up to this point.
                        When I crafted the coconut canister, a tear came down my left cheek.

                        I quit the game for a couple of months and decided to check up on the game. Then I saw a new macro that was available on Mac! This was revolution macro, the chatgpt of macros. It literally uses AI to help detect aspects of the game, 
                        making the macro even more effcient and acccurate. This brought me back to the game because I didn't need to manually grind everything. Through revolution macro, I was able to grind alot faster and allowed me to level up my hive and get more
                        mythic bees.

                        The picture above shows my hive on the left. With the new help of a macro that runs 24/7 my progression speed tripled and I was able to upgrade my hive. I use to only have 5-6 mythic bees. After lots of grinding I was able to get almost a full hive of mythic blue bees. 
                        I don't want a full hive of blue bees as some bees when gifted have a special stat boost that is neccesary for me to make a good amount of honey. So I decided to invest the remainder of my honey into buying treats to
                        upgrade my bees so that they make more pollen and produce more honey.

This is also my current day stage where I am still in the process of grinding for the tide popper. As seen, majority of the materials needed are highlighted white meaning that I already have them. However, I am still missing a couple things such
                        as the bucko bee quests and the 50 super smoothies. I am super duper close to being able to craft the tide popper. For those that need context, the tide popper is the holy grail of all blue hives (me), it is the best END GAME 
                        blue hive item that produces the most amount of honey.
